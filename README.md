# ATM-Simulation-System
A Python-based ATM Simulation System that supports user authentication, Balance Checking, and withdrawals. It allows only three attempts to the user, which protects your account from unauthourised person. If any unauthorised person tries to access your account without your permission, it will lock your account after 3 attempts.
The system uses a menu-driven approach implemented with loops and match-case, ensuring continuous interaction until the user chooses to exit. It also includes security features like limited login attempts and account blocking after three incorrect PIN entries. Additionally, the program handles validation for transactions and provides a low balance warning when funds drop below a defined threshold.
This project used programming fundamentals concepts
It serves as a foundational implementation of how ATM systems manage user authentication and transactions.
